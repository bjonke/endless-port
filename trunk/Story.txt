The tavern owner greets you and tells you that he has heard a rumor about a person in another city that knows
more about the location of this forgotten city called mordor.

The tavern owner is silent at first then after you reveal that you have spoken with the former tavern owner
he tells you about a city where you might be able to find some sort of a map that can tell you more about the
cities location.

I might have what you are looking for but it will cost you some coins, so if you could part from 100 gold
then I might have some information or item for you.

as you pay the inn keeper he opens a drawer in the bardisk and pulls forward a parchment of some sort, as he
unfolds it you see that it is a map with only one city visible on it.

Ohh you have been sold that map, that tavern keeper is always after some quick gold. You are the 4th person
passing by this month that have been searching for that city and ended up here instead. I cant tell you more then
I told the others that there is a city close by here where you might find some more information about this lost
city of yours.

Ahhhh welcome traveller I have some information for you, the city is told to be located in the northern parts of the
world. I hope that will help you on your quest.

Yes he was right its up north here somewhere I guess more to the west because there are so many cities to the east
that if there was a city located there it sure wouldn't be lost for long.

Soo yet another traveller have found our city, I must dissappoint you however that this isn't the city you are looking
for but I know where you can find it. ( Leave the city and you will see the cities location ).
