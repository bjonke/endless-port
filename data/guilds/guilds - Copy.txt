Fighter,Warriors live for combat and the thrill of battle. They are the best fighters of all the classes but lack the subtle skills of thieves and the magical talents of mages and priests. Warriors are best for those who don't mind taking the direct approach even when another method might be called for.,1,1,1,1,1,1
Mage,Magic is work the like of which no guild has ever seen. A well-trained mage firm in purpose and strong in skill will stand his ground in the face of appalling danger. Nothing is unexpected of him; his arsenal of lore was assembled on the premise that all things are likely to befall. A mage may have to cut and run but he will do so judiciously effectively and to advantage. Mages are not fond of working with their hands but of necessity they search out magic articles if they cannot borrow or barter for them from others or if they have no such tools handed down to them by older mages of yore. They tend to be poor fighters with little knowledge of weaponry. However they command powerful and dangerous energies with a few simple gestures and mystical words. The very skills and arts which a mage uses for the benefit of others and for his own benevolent projects are fell weapons to match when turned to evil ends. After centuries of straightening out adjusting rescuing and setting to rights the affairs of the world a mage may begin to think he is better equipped to run the world than anyone else. If he succumbs to this urge he is a formidable opponent to put down. A good mage is forced to hold himself and his magic in check a bit--ride a little less swiftly blast a little less blitseringly smite less shatteringly than he is able in order not to slay idle bystanders. But where the welfare of others is no longer his concern the full force of his power may be felt and much woe unleashed into the world.,1,1,1,1,1,1
Cleric,The holy cleric. In addition to their god-like healing powers the healer has control over powerful followers through their willed protector ability and the prayer of guardianship - which calls forth a truly powerful being. Healers have an array of offensive skills and spells as well as utility abilities which rival any class. Healers are an asset to any group but can travel alone without any trouble due to their controlled followers and offensive abilities.,1,1,1,1,1,1
Thief,Thieves are the masters of stealth supreme in sneaking backstabbing and assassination. Thieves rule the underworld both on the Surface and in the Underdark wherever criminals may gather together. Other thieves prefer to work alone and avoid the company of their peers. Thieves are inferior to warriors barbarians and some of the other more battle-oriented classes in face-to-face combat although they can outmatch the pure spell-casting classes physically. Like warriors thieves have no magical power but have no compunction about using magical items.,1,1,1,1,1,1
